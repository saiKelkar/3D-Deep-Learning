# 3D Deep Learning ‚Äì Notes and Experiments

This repository documents my journey into **3D Deep Learning**, following the work and materials provided by **Dr. Florent Poux**, including his book and supporting projects.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Understand the **mathematical foundations** and **representations** of 3D data (voxels, point clouds, meshes)
- Implement foundational and advanced **3D deep learning models**
- Explore real-world use cases in **geometry processing, scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, and AR/VR**

## üìö Learning Sources

- *Deep Learning for 3D Data* by Dr. Florent Poux (book & drive content)
- Poux‚Äôs YouTube tutorials, GitHub repos, and workshops
- Additional academic papers (e.g. PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, KPConv)
